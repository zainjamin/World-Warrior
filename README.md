# World-Warrior
An environmental game created for Hack the North 2021

## Inspiration

**More that 1 million species face extinction**
**Sea levels are rising**
**Our resources are running out**
Although climate change affects every single person on the planet, there are still countless people who deny it’s actions. With the topic of environmental sustainability becoming increasingly relevant among adults and youth, our team decided to create a game that would foster an understanding of the basics of protecting our ecosystem through recycling. While climate change could become irreversible by 2030, the Earth can prepare itself for this crisis by educating it’s people. By teaching students and future change makers about how to properly treat our one and only planet, we can play a crucial part in ensuring a sustainable and healthy future for generations to come. Though recycling is only a small factor that contributes to the overall problem of climate change, raising awareness is the spark that will ignite within the hearts of future World Warriors.  

## What it does

World Warrior is a 2D top-down video game that places the user in the shoes of a typical person, carrying out their life while trying to protect the environment. The player goes through a typical day, making common everyday choices that impact our environment. At the end of the game, we’ll talk you through the choices you made throughout the game and how much a certain choice impacted our environment. We hope that this game will educate the player to know how much their choices actually affect our environment, and how much harm making the “wrong” decision can do. We hope that we can begin the conversation between our players and others about what they can do to save our world.

## How we built it

To begin our endeavor of creating the game World Warrior, we first investigated a variety of game engines that we could use, and decided to use Unity. Through Github, we were able to work separately on Unity, with the occasional merging of branches. During this time, we created the first tilemap, an item interaction system using script inheritance and player movement. Eventually, we discovered Unity Teams which allowed us to work on the same file simultaneously. Once we understood the process of syncing new updates, we began to create the trash sorting system and the interactions between the player and the objects. The park was also created, which offers a second location to demonstrate environmentally sustainable actions. 

## Challenges we ran into

The most challenging part of our project was understanding the functionality of Unity in creating a collaborative space. Github presented us with many problems as Unity would block certain features when merging branches. We spent numerous hours deciding between the use of GitHub to combine files; however, once we discovered Unity Teams, our collaborative problems all came to an end. Of course another major challenge we had was battling our body’s urge to fall asleep, however with enough caffeine, we were wide awake. Additionally, our knowledge as high school students can prove to be a challenge as much of the content we are creating is entirely new to us. This however is beneficial, as it is only when we fail and make mistakes, that we learn how to use new software and languages. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The accomplishments that we are the most proud of would be our resilience and perseverance throughout the 36 hour period. Unity was a new piece of software for most of us, so it was extremely rewarding to see a working demo of our game. Every time we added a new feature to our game, there would be a sigh of relief when the expected outcome occurred. Overall, we are proud of our ability to dedicate time and effort into creating a fun project while learning along the way.

## What we learned

The entire hackathon process was a learning experience for us all. We learned about the versatile uses of Unity and how to code in C#. Though we have experience in Java, it was nice to extend our knowledge to attempt understand C#. One specific moment where we learned not just some fancy softwares, but a valuable life lesson was our swap from Github to Unity Teams. This was a crucial learning moment for us, as we learned to approach our issues from multiple perspectives and decide which would benefit the group the most. It was instrumental to our success that we continued to problem solve and work as a team to fix our errors. 

## What's next for World Warrior

World Warrior has a plethora of options to expand its narrative as well as its gameplay. Firstly, more prompts can be added to present the player with more opportunities to learn about sustainable life choices. This could include more locations that are practical and relate to the typical person. Additionally, a narrative could be incorporated to further enhance the experience of the game. In general, we want World Warrior to be an educational tool that acts as a fun way to educate people about how to reduce their environmental impact.
